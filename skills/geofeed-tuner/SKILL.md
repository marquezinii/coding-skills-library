# Geofeed Tuner – Create Better IP Geolocation Feeds

This skill helps you create and improve IP geolocation feeds in CSV format by:
- Ensuring your CSV is well-formed and consistent
- Checking alignment with [RFC 8805](references/rfc8805.txt) (the industry standard)
- Applying **opinionated best practices** learned from real-world deployments
- Suggesting improvements for accuracy, completeness, and privacy

## When to Use This Skill

- Use this skill when a user asks for help **creating, improving, or publishing** an IP geolocation feed file in CSV format.
- Use it to **tune and troubleshoot CSV geolocation feeds** — catching errors, suggesting improvements, and ensuring real-world usability beyond RFC compliance.
- **Intended audience:**
  - Network operators, administrators, and engineers responsible for publicly routable IP address space
  - Organizations such as ISPs, mobile carriers, cloud providers, hosting and colocation companies, Internet Exchange operators, and satellite internet providers
- **Do not use** this skill for private or internal IP address management; it applies **only to publicly routable IP addresses**.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3** is required.

## Directory Structure and File Management

This skill uses a clear separation between **distribution files** (read-only) and **working files** (generated at runtime).

### Read-Only Directories (Do Not Modify)

The following directories contain static distribution assets. **Do not create, modify, or delete files in these directories:**

| Directory      | Purpose                                                    |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `assets/`      | Static data files (ISO codes, examples)                    |
| `references/`  | RFC specifications and code snippets for reference         |
| `scripts/`     | Executable code and HTML template files for reports        |

### Working Directories (Generated Content)

All generated, temporary, and output files go in these directories:

| Directory       | Purpose                                              |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `run/`          | Working directory for all agent-generated content    |
| `run/data/`     | Downloaded CSV files from remote URLs                |
| `run/report/`   | Generated HTML tuning reports                        |

### File Management Rules

1. **Never write to `assets/`, `references/`, or `scripts/`** — these are part of the skill distribution and must remain unchanged.
2. **All downloaded input files** (from remote URLs) must be saved to `./run/data/`.
3. **All generated HTML reports** must be saved to `./run/report/`.
4. **All generated Python scripts** must be saved to `./run/`.
5. The `run/` directory may be cleared between sessions; do not store permanent data there.
6. **Working directory for execution:** All generated scripts in `./run/` must be executed with the **skill root directory** (the directory containing `SKILL.md`) as the current working directory, so that relative paths like `assets/iso3166-1.json` and `./run/data/report-data.json` resolve correctly. Do not `cd` into `./run/` before running scripts.


## Processing Pipeline: Sequential Phase Execution

All phases must be executed **in order**, from Phase 1 through Phase 6. Each phase depends on the successful completion of the previous phase. For example, **structure checks** must complete before **quality analysis** can run.

The phases are summarized below. The agent must follow the detailed steps outlined further in each phase section.

| Phase | Name                       | Description                                                                       |
|-------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Understand the Standard    | Review the key requirements of RFC 8805 for self-published IP geolocation feeds   |
| 2     | Gather Input               | Collect IP subnet data from local files or remote URLs                            |
| 3     | Checks & Suggestions       | Validate CSV structure, analyze IP prefixes, and check data quality               |
| 4     | Tuning Data Lookup         | Use Fastah's MCP tool to retrieve tuning data for improving geolocation accuracy  |
| 5     | Generate Tuning Report     | Create an HTML report summarizing the analysis and suggestions                    |
| 6     | Final Review               | Verify consistency and completeness of the report data                            |

**Do not skip phases.** Each phase provides critical checks or data transformations required by subsequent stages.


### Execution Plan Rules

Before executing each phase, the agent MUST generate a visible TODO checklist.

The plan MUST:
- Appear at the very start of the phase
- List every step in order
- Use a checkbox format
- Be updated live as steps complete


### Phase 1: Understand the Standard

The key requirements from RFC 8805 that this skill enforces are summarized below. **Use this summary as your working reference.** Only consult the full [RFC 8805 text](references/rfc8805.txt) for edge cases, ambiguous situations, or when the user asks a standards question not covered here.

#### RFC 8805 Key Facts

**Purpose:** A self-published IP geolocation feed lets network operators publish authoritative location data for their IP address space in a simple CSV format, allowing geolocation providers to incorporate operator-supplied corrections.

**CSV Column Order (Sections 2.1.1.1–2.1.1.5):**

| Column | Field         | Required | Notes                                                      |
|--------|---------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | `ip_prefix`   | Yes      | CIDR notation; IPv4 or IPv6; must be a network address     |
| 2      | `alpha2code`  | No       | ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code; empty or "ZZ" = do-not-geolocate |
| 3      | `region`      | No       | ISO 3166-2 subdivision code (e.g., `US-CA`)               |
| 4      | `city`        | No       | Free-text city name; no authoritative validation set       |
| 5      | `postal_code` | No       | **Deprecated** — must be left empty or absent             |

**Structural rules:**
- Files may contain comment lines beginning with `#` (including the header, if present).
- A header row is optional; if present, it is treated as a comment if it starts with `#`.
- Files must be encoded in UTF-8.
- Subnet host bits must not be set (i.e., `192.168.1.1/24` is invalid; use `192.168.1.0/24`).
- Applies only to **globally routable** unicast addresses — not private, loopback, link-local, or multicast space.

**Do-not-geolocate:** An entry with an empty `alpha2code` or case-insensitive `ZZ` (irrespective of values of region/city) is an explicit signal that the operator does not want geolocation applied to that prefix.

**Postal codes deprecated (Section 2.1.1.5):** The fifth column must not contain postal or ZIP codes. They are too fine-grained for IP-range mapping and raise privacy concerns.


### Phase 2: Gather Input

- If the user has not already provided a list of IP subnets or ranges (sometimes referred to as `inetnum` or `inet6num`), prompt them to supply it. Accepted input formats:
  - Text pasted into the chat
  - A local CSV file
  - A remote URL pointing to a CSV file

- If the input is a **remote URL**:
  - Attempt to download the CSV file to `./run/data/` before processing.
  - On HTTP error (4xx, 5xx, timeout, or redirect loop), **stop immediately** and report to the user:
    `Feed URL is not reachable: HTTP {status_code}. Please verify the URL is publicly accessible.`
  - Do not proceed to Phase 3 with an incomplete or empty download.

- If the input is a **local file**, process it directly without downloading.

- **Encoding detection and normalization:**
  1. Attempt to read the file as UTF-8 first.
  2. If a `UnicodeDecodeError` is raised, try `utf-8-sig` (UTF-8 with BOM), then `latin-1`.
  3. Once successfully decoded, re-encode and write the working copy as UTF-8.
  4. If no encoding succeeds, stop and report: `Unable to decode input file. Please save it as UTF-8 and try again.`
