## Advanced Usage

### Tips and Tricks

| Tip | Why It Helps |
|-----|--------------|
| Use LLVM 18+ with `-show-directory-coverage` | Organizes large reports by directory structure instead of flat file list |
| Export to lcov format for better HTML | `llvm-cov export -format=lcov` + `genhtml` provides cleaner per-file reports |
| Compare coverage across campaigns | Store `.profdata` files with timestamps to track progress over time |
| Filter harness code from reports | Use `-ignore-filename-regex` to focus on SUT coverage only |
| Automate coverage in CI/CD | Generate coverage reports automatically after scheduled fuzzing runs |
| Use gcovr 5.1+ for Clang 14+ | Older gcovr versions have compatibility issues with recent LLVM |

### Incremental Coverage Updates

GCC's gcov instrumentation incrementally updates `.gcda` files across multiple runs. This is useful for tracking coverage as you add test cases:

```bash
# First run
./fuzz_exec_gcov corpus_batch_1/
gcovr --html coverage_v1.html

# Second run (adds to existing coverage)
./fuzz_exec_gcov corpus_batch_2/
gcovr --html coverage_v2.html

# Start fresh
gcovr --delete  # Remove .gcda files
./fuzz_exec_gcov corpus/
```

### Handling Large Codebases

For projects with hundreds of source files:

1. **Filter by prefix**: Only generate reports for relevant directories
   ```bash
   llvm-cov show ./fuzz_exec -instr-profile=fuzz.profdata /path/to/src/
   ```

2. **Use directory coverage**: Group by directory to reduce clutter (LLVM 18+)
   ```bash
   llvm-cov show -show-directory-coverage -format=html -output-dir html/
   ```

3. **Generate JSON for programmatic analysis**:
   ```bash
   llvm-cov export -format=lcov > coverage.json
   ```

### Differential Coverage

Compare coverage between two fuzzing campaigns:

```bash
# Campaign 1
LLVM_PROFILE_FILE=campaign1.profraw ./fuzz_exec corpus1/
llvm-profdata merge -sparse campaign1.profraw -o campaign1.profdata

# Campaign 2
LLVM_PROFILE_FILE=campaign2.profraw ./fuzz_exec corpus2/
llvm-profdata merge -sparse campaign2.profraw -o campaign2.profdata

# Compare
llvm-cov show ./fuzz_exec \
  -instr-profile=campaign2.profdata \
  -instr-profile=campaign1.profdata \
  -show-line-counts-or-regions
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Correct Approach |
|--------------|---------|------------------|
| Using fuzzer-reported coverage for comparisons | Different fuzzers calculate coverage differently, making cross-tool comparison meaningless | Use dedicated coverage tools (llvm-cov, gcovr) for reproducible measurements |
| Generating coverage with optimizations | `-O3` optimizations can eliminate code, making coverage misleading | Use `-O2` or `-O0` for coverage builds |
| Not filtering harness code | Harness coverage inflates numbers and obscures SUT coverage | Use `-ignore-filename-regex` or `--exclude` to filter harness files |
| Mixing LLVM and GCC instrumentation | Incompatible formats cause parsing failures | Stick to one toolchain for coverage builds |
| Ignoring crashing inputs | Crashes prevent coverage generation, hiding real coverage data | Fix crashes first, or use process forking to isolate them |
| Not tracking coverage over time | One-time coverage checks miss regressions and improvements | Store coverage data with timestamps and track trends |

## Tool-Specific Guidance

### libFuzzer

libFuzzer uses LLVM's SanitizerCoverage by default for guiding fuzzing, but you need separate instrumentation for generating reports.

**Build for coverage:**
```bash
clang++ -fprofile-instr-generate -fcoverage-mapping \
  -O2 -DNO_MAIN \
  main.cc harness.cc execute-rt.cc -o fuzz_exec
```

**Execute corpus and generate report:**
```bash
LLVM_PROFILE_FILE=fuzz.profraw ./fuzz_exec corpus/
llvm-profdata merge -sparse fuzz.profraw -o fuzz.profdata
llvm-cov show ./fuzz_exec -instr-profile=fuzz.profdata -format=html -output-dir html/
```

**Integration tips:**
- Don't use `-fsanitize=fuzzer` for coverage builds (it conflicts with profile instrumentation)
- Reuse the same harness function (`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`) with a different main function
- Use the `-ignore-filename-regex` flag to exclude harness code from coverage reports
- Consider using llvm-cov's `-show-instantiation` flag for template-heavy C++ code

### AFL++

AFL++ provides its own coverage feedback mechanism, but for detailed reports use standard LLVM/GCC tools.

**Build for coverage with LLVM:**
```bash
clang++ -fprofile-instr-generate -fcoverage-mapping \
  -O2 main.cc harness.cc execute-rt.cc -o fuzz_exec
```

**Build for coverage with GCC:**
```bash
AFL_USE_ASAN=0 afl-gcc -ftest-coverage -fprofile-arcs \
  main.cc harness.cc execute-rt.cc -o fuzz_exec_gcov
```

**Execute and generate report:**
```bash
# LLVM approach
LLVM_PROFILE_FILE=fuzz.profraw ./fuzz_exec afl_output/queue/
llvm-profdata merge -sparse fuzz.profraw -o fuzz.profdata
llvm-cov report ./fuzz_exec -instr-profile=fuzz.profdata

# GCC approach
./fuzz_exec_gcov afl_output/queue/
gcovr --html-details -o coverage.html
```

**Integration tips:**
- Don't use AFL++'s instrumentation (`afl-clang-fast`) for coverage builds
- Use standard compilers with coverage flags instead
- AFL++'s `queue/` directory contains your corpus
- AFL++'s built-in coverage statistics are useful for real-time monitoring but not for detailed analysis

### cargo-fuzz (Rust)

cargo-fuzz provides built-in coverage generation using LLVM tools.

**Install prerequisites:**
```bash
rustup toolchain install nightly --component llvm-tools-preview
cargo install cargo-binutils rustfilt
```

**Generate coverage data:**
```bash
cargo +nightly fuzz coverage fuzz_target_1
```

**Create HTML report script:**
```bash
cat <<'EOF' > ./generate_html
#!/bin/sh
FUZZ_TARGET="$1"
shift
SRC_FILTER="$@"
TARGET=$(rustc -vV | sed -n 's|host: ||p')
cargo +nightly cov -- show -Xdemangler=rustfilt \
  "target/$TARGET/coverage/$TARGET/release/$FUZZ_TARGET" \
  -instr-profile="fuzz/coverage/$FUZZ_TARGET/coverage.profdata" \
  -show-line-counts-or-regions -show-instantiations \
  -format=html -o fuzz_html/ $SRC_FILTER
EOF
chmod +x ./generate_html
```

**Generate report:**
```bash
./generate_html fuzz_target_1 src/lib.rs
```

**Integration tips:**
- Always use the nightly toolchain for coverage
- The `-Xdemangler=rustfilt` flag makes function names readable
- Filter by source files (e.g., `src/lib.rs`) to focus on crate code
- Use `-show-line-counts-or-regions` and `-show-instantiations` for better Rust-specific output
- Corpus is located in `fuzz/corpus/<target>/`

### honggfuzz

honggfuzz works with standard LLVM/GCC coverage instrumentation.

**Build for coverage:**
```bash
# Use standard compiler, not honggfuzz compiler
clang -fprofile-instr-generate -fcoverage-mapping \
  -O2 harness.c execute-rt.c -o fuzz_exec
```

**Execute corpus:**
```bash
LLVM_PROFILE_FILE=fuzz.profraw ./fuzz_exec honggfuzz_workspace/
```

**Integration tips:**
- Don't use `hfuzz-clang` for coverage builds
- honggfuzz corpus is typically in a workspace directory
- Use the same LLVM workflow as libFuzzer

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `error: no profile data available` | Profile wasn't generated or wrong path | Verify `LLVM_PROFILE_FILE` was set and `.profraw` file exists |
| `Failed to load coverage` | Mismatch between binary and profile data | Rebuild binary with same flags used during execution |
| Coverage reports show 0% | Wrong binary used for report generation | Use the instrumented binary, not the fuzzing binary |
| `no_working_dir_found` error (gcovr) | `.gcda` files in unexpected location | Add `--gcov-ignore-errors=no_working_dir_found` flag |
| Crashes prevent coverage generation | Corpus contains crashing inputs | Filter crashes or use forking approach to isolate failures |
| Coverage decreases after harness change | Harness now skips certain code paths | Review harness logic; may need to support more input formats |
| HTML report is flat file list | Using older LLVM version | Upgrade to LLVM 18+ and use `-show-directory-coverage` |
| `incompatible instrumentation` | Mixing LLVM and GCC coverage | Rebuild everything with same toolchain |
