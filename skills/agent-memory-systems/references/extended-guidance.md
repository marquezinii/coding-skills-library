## Sharp Edges

### Chunking Isolates Information From Its Context

Severity: CRITICAL

Situation: Processing documents for vector storage

Symptoms:
Retrieval finds chunks but they don't make sense alone. Agent
answers miss the big picture. "The function returns X" retrieved
without knowing which function. References to "this" without
knowing what "this" refers to.

Why this breaks:
When we chunk for AI processing, we're breaking connections,
reducing a holistic narrative to isolated fragments that often
miss the big picture. A chunk about "the configuration" without
context about what system is being configured is nearly useless.

Recommended fix:

### Contextual Chunking (Anthropic's approach)
# Add document context to each chunk before embedding
# Reduces retrieval failures by 35%

def contextualize_chunk(chunk, document):
    summary = summarize(document)

    # LLM generates context for chunk
    context = llm.invoke(f'''
        Document summary: {summary}

        Generate a brief context statement for this chunk
        that would help someone understand what it refers to:

        {chunk}
    ''')

    return f"{context}\n\n{chunk}"

# Embed the contextualized version
for chunk in chunks:
    contextualized = contextualize_chunk(chunk, full_doc)
    embedding = embed(contextualized)
    # Store original chunk, embed contextualized
    store(original=chunk, embedding=embedding)

## Hierarchical Chunking
# Store at multiple granularities
chunks_small = split(doc, size=256)
chunks_medium = split(doc, size=512)
chunks_large = split(doc, size=1024)

# Retrieve at appropriate level based on query

### Chunk Size Mismatched to Query Patterns

Severity: HIGH

Situation: Configuring chunking for memory storage

Symptoms:
High-quality documents produce low-quality retrievals. Simple
questions miss relevant information. Complex questions get
fragments instead of complete answers.

Why this breaks:
Optimal chunk size depends on query patterns:
- Factual queries need small, specific chunks
- Conceptual queries need larger context
- Code needs function-level boundaries

The sweet spot varies by document type and embedding model.
Default 1000 characters works for nothing specific.

Recommended fix:

## Test different sizes
from sklearn.metrics import recall_score

def evaluate_chunk_size(documents, test_queries, chunk_size):
    chunks = split_documents(documents, size=chunk_size)
    index = build_index(chunks)

    correct_retrievals = 0
    for query, expected_chunk in test_queries:
        results = index.search(query, k=5)
        if expected_chunk in results:
            correct_retrievals += 1

    return correct_retrievals / len(test_queries)

# Test multiple sizes
for size in [256, 512, 768, 1024]:
    recall = evaluate_chunk_size(docs, test_queries, size)
    print(f"Size {size}: Recall@5 = {recall:.2%}")

## Size recommendations by content type
CHUNK_SIZES = {
    "documentation": 512,   # Complete concepts
    "code": 1000,          # Function-level
    "conversation": 256,   # Turn-level
    "articles": 768,       # Paragraph-level
}

## Use overlap to prevent boundary issues
splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=512,
    chunk_overlap=50,  # 10% overlap
)

### Semantic Search Returns Irrelevant Results

Severity: HIGH

Situation: Querying memory for context

Symptoms:
Agent retrieves memories that seem related but aren't useful.
"Tell me about the user's preferences" returns conversation
about preferences in general, not this user's. High similarity
scores for wrong content.

Why this breaks:
Semantic similarity isn't the same as relevance. "The user
likes Python" and "Python is a programming language" are
semantically similar but very different types of information.
Without metadata filtering, retrieval is just word matching.

Recommended fix:

## Always filter by metadata first
# Don't rely on semantic similarity alone

# Bad: Only semantic search
results = index.query(
    vector=query_embedding,
    top_k=5
)

# Good: Filter then search
results = index.query(
    vector=query_embedding,
    filter={
        "user_id": current_user.id,
        "type": "preference",
        "created_after": cutoff_date,
    },
    top_k=5
)

## Use hybrid search (semantic + keyword)
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient

client = QdrantClient(...)

# Hybrid search with fusion
results = client.search(
    collection_name="memories",
    query_vector=semantic_embedding,
    query_text=query,  # Also keyword match
    fusion={"method": "rrf"},  # Reciprocal Rank Fusion
)

## Rerank results with cross-encoder
from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder

reranker = CrossEncoder("cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2")

# Initial retrieval (recall-oriented)
candidates = index.query(query_embedding, top_k=20)

# Rerank (precision-oriented)
pairs = [(query, c.text) for c in candidates]
scores = reranker.predict(pairs)
reranked = sorted(zip(candidates, scores), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

### Old Memories Override Current Information

Severity: HIGH

Situation: User preferences or facts change over time

Symptoms:
Agent uses outdated preferences. "User prefers dark mode" from
6 months ago overrides recent "switch to light mode" request.
Agent confidently uses stale data.

Why this breaks:
Vector stores don't have temporal awareness by default. A memory
from a year ago has the same retrieval weight as one from today.
Recent information should generally override old information
for preferences and mutable facts.

Recommended fix:

## Add temporal scoring
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def time_decay_score(memory, half_life_days=30):
    age = (datetime.now() - memory.created_at).days
    decay = 0.5 ** (age / half_life_days)
    return decay

def retrieve_with_recency(query, user_id):
    # Get candidates
    candidates = index.query(
        vector=embed(query),
        filter={"user_id": user_id},
        top_k=20
    )

    # Apply time decay
    for candidate in candidates:
        time_score = time_decay_score(candidate)
        candidate.final_score = candidate.similarity * 0.7 + time_score * 0.3

    # Re-sort by final score
    return sorted(candidates, key=lambda x: x.final_score, reverse=True)[:5]

## Update instead of append for preferences
async def update_preference(user_id, category, value):
    # Delete old preference
    await memory.delete(
        filter={"user_id": user_id, "type": "preference", "category": category}
    )

    # Store new preference
    await memory.upsert(
        id=f"pref-{user_id}-{category}",
        content={"category": category, "value": value},
        metadata={"updated_at": datetime.now()}
    )

## Explicit versioning for facts
await memory.upsert(
    id=f"fact-{fact_id}-v{version}",
    content=new_fact,
    metadata={
        "version": version,
        "supersedes": previous_id,
        "valid_from": datetime.now()
    }
)

### Contradictory Memories Retrieved Together

Severity: MEDIUM

Situation: User has changed preferences or provided conflicting info

Symptoms:
Agent retrieves "user prefers dark mode" and "user prefers light
mode" in same context. Gives inconsistent answers. Seems confused
or forgetful to user.

Why this breaks:
Without conflict resolution, both old and new information coexist.
Semantic search might return both because they're both about the
same topic (preferences). Agent has no way to know which is current.

Recommended fix:

## Detect conflicts on storage
async def store_with_conflict_check(memory, user_id):
    # Find potentially conflicting memories
    similar = await index.query(
        vector=embed(memory.content),
        filter={"user_id": user_id, "type": memory.type},
        threshold=0.9,  # Very similar
        top_k=5
    )

    for existing in similar:
        if is_contradictory(memory.content, existing.content):
            # Ask for resolution
            resolution = await resolve_conflict(memory, existing)
            if resolution == "replace":
                await index.delete(existing.id)
            elif resolution == "version":
                await mark_superseded(existing.id, memory.id)

    await index.upsert(memory)

## Conflict detection heuristic
def is_contradictory(new_content, old_content):
    # Use LLM to detect contradiction
    result = llm.invoke(f'''
        Do these two statements contradict each other?

        Statement 1: {old_content}
        Statement 2: {new_content}

        Respond with just YES or NO.
    ''')
    return result.strip().upper() == "YES"

## Periodic consolidation
async def consolidate_memories(user_id):
    all_memories = await index.list(filter={"user_id": user_id})
    clusters = cluster_by_topic(all_memories)

    for cluster in clusters:
        if has_conflicts(cluster):
            resolved = await llm.invoke(f'''
                These memories may conflict. Create one consolidated
                memory that represents the current truth:
                {cluster}
            ''')
            await replace_cluster(cluster, resolved)

### Retrieved Memories Exceed Context Window

Severity: MEDIUM

Situation: Retrieving too many memories at once

Symptoms:
Token limit errors. Agent truncates important information.
System prompt gets cut off. Retrieved memories compete with
user query for space.

Why this breaks:
Retrieval typically returns top-k results. If k is too high or
chunks are too large, retrieved context overwhelms the window.
Critical information (system prompt, recent messages) gets pushed
out.

Recommended fix:

## Budget tokens for different memory types
TOKEN_BUDGET = {
    "system_prompt": 500,
    "user_profile": 200,
    "recent_messages": 2000,
    "retrieved_memories": 1000,
    "current_query": 500,
    "buffer": 300,  # Safety margin
}

def budget_aware_retrieval(query, context_limit=4000):
    remaining = context_limit - TOKEN_BUDGET["system_prompt"] - TOKEN_BUDGET["buffer"]

    # Prioritize recent messages
    recent = get_recent_messages(limit=TOKEN_BUDGET["recent_messages"])
    remaining -= count_tokens(recent)

    # Then user profile
    profile = get_user_profile(limit=TOKEN_BUDGET["user_profile"])
    remaining -= count_tokens(profile)

    # Finally retrieved memories with remaining budget
    memories = retrieve_memories(query, max_tokens=remaining)

    return build_context(profile, recent, memories)

## Dynamic k based on chunk size
def retrieve_with_budget(query, max_tokens=1000):
    avg_chunk_tokens = 150  # From your data
    max_k = max_tokens // avg_chunk_tokens

    results = index.query(query, top_k=max_k)

    # Trim if still over budget
    total_tokens = 0
    filtered = []
    for result in results:
        tokens = count_tokens(result.text)
        if total_tokens + tokens <= max_tokens:
            filtered.append(result)
            total_tokens += tokens
        else:
            break

    return filtered

### Query and Document Embeddings From Different Models

Severity: MEDIUM

Situation: Upgrading embedding model or mixing providers

Symptoms:
Retrieval quality suddenly drops. Relevant documents not found.
Random results returned. Works for new documents, fails for old.

Why this breaks:
Embedding models produce different vector spaces. A query embedded
with text-embedding-3 won't match documents embedded with text-ada-002.
Mixing models creates garbage similarity scores.

Recommended fix:

## Track embedding model in metadata
await index.upsert(
    id=doc_id,
    vector=embedding,
    metadata={
        "embedding_model": "text-embedding-3-small",
        "embedding_version": "2024-01",
        "content": content
    }
)

## Filter by model version on retrieval
results = index.query(
    vector=query_embedding,
    filter={"embedding_model": current_model},
    top_k=10
)

## Migration strategy for model upgrades
async def migrate_embeddings(old_model, new_model):
    # Get all documents with old model
    old_docs = await index.list(filter={"embedding_model": old_model})

    for doc in old_docs:
        # Re-embed with new model
        new_embedding = await embed(doc.content, model=new_model)

        # Update in place
        await index.update(
            id=doc.id,
            vector=new_embedding,
            metadata={"embedding_model": new_model}
        )

## Use separate collections during migration
# Old collection: production queries
# New collection: re-embedding in progress
# Switch over when complete

## Validation Checks
